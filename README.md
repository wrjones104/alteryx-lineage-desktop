<img src="src/assets/splash.jpg" alt="logo" width="50%" height="50%"/>

## 1. High-Level Goal

This is a self-contained desktop application designed to parse Alteryx workflow files (`.yxmd`) and build an interactive data lineage map. It uses a shared SQLite database file (called a "workspace"), allowing a team to collaboratively visualize workflow inputs, outputs, and dependencies, and to identify critical workflows within your data ecosystem.

## 2. Key Features

* **Shared Workspaces:** Create, open, or connect to a shared SQLite database file on a local or network drive.
* **Welcome Screen:** Easily access your 5 most recent workspaces.
* **Drag & Drop:** Simply drag your `.yxmd` files onto the main window to automatically parse and add them to the lineage map.
* **Impact Analysis:** Automatically calculates a "Criticality Score" for each workflow based on its total downstream dependencies, helping you identify the most critical parts of your data ecosystem.
* **Multiple Views:**
    * **Graph View:** An interactive, force-directed graph powered by D3.js. Nodes can be moved, inspected, and searched.
    * **Report View:** A clear, list-based view of all workflow inputs and outputs.
    * **Impact View:** A ranked table of all workflows by their "Criticality Score".
* **Workflow Management:** Add or delete workflows from your workspace. Deletion includes a confirmation step to prevent accidents.
* **Quick Navigation:** Jump directly from the Impact Analysis report to any workflow in the Graph or Report views.
* **Data Source Aliasing:** Give user-friendly names to cryptic database connections or file paths.
* **Integrated Help:** Access the `USAGE.md` guide directly from the "Help" menu.
