# Alteryx Lineage Viewer (Desktop)

<img src="src/assets/splash.jpg" alt="logo" width="30%" height="30%"/>

## 1. High-Level Goal

This is a self-contained desktop application designed to parse Alteryx workflow files (`.yxmd`) and build an interactive data lineage map. It uses a shared SQLite database file (called a "workspace"), allowing a team to collaboratively visualize workflow inputs, outputs, and data dependencies across multiple processes from a shared network drive.

## 2. Key Features

* **Shared Workspaces:** Connect to a shared SQLite database file on a local or network drive.
* **Welcome Screen:** Easily create new workspaces, open existing ones, or select from a list of your 5 most recent workspaces.
* **Drag & Drop:** Simply drag your `.yxmd` files onto the main window to automatically parse and add them to the lineage map.
* **Interactive Graph:** Visualize workflows and data sources in a force-directed graph powered by D3.js. Nodes can be moved, inspected, and searched.
* **Report View:** See a clear, list-based view of all workflow inputs and outputs.
* **Data Source Aliasing:** Give user-friendly names to cryptic database connections or file paths.
* **Native Application Menu:** Access all workspace functions (Create, Open, Open Recent) through the native "File" menu.

## 5. Building the Portable Application

This project is configured to build a portable application that does not require an installation process.

1.  **Run the build command:**
    ```sh
    npm run make
    ```
2.  This command will package the application and create the distributables in the `/out` folder. The output for Windows will be located in `out/make/zip/win32-x64`.

## 6. How to Use the Final App

1.  Unzip the application folder generated by the build process. You can place this folder anywhere, including on a shared network drive.
2.  Launch the application by double-clicking the `alteryx-lineage-desktop.exe` file.
3.  From the welcome screen, choose one of the options:
    * **Create New Workspace:** This will open a "Save" dialog, allowing you to create a new `.sqlite` database file in a location of your choice.
    * **Open Existing Workspace:** This will open a file browser, allowing you to select a pre-existing `.sqlite` workspace file.
    * **Recent Workspaces:** Click on a file from the list to open it directly.
4.  Once in the main view, drag and drop your `.yxmd` files onto the application window to populate the lineage map.
